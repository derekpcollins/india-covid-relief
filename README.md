## About
My name is [Derek P. Collins](https://derekpcollins.com/about) and I've had the privilege of visiting India several times (and I look forward to visiting much more in the future). I have friends and colleagues that live throughout India. When I started to hear about how devastating this second wave of COVID-19 was, I felt helpless and I wanted to find some way to help from afar. I started to look into organizations to donate to, but I had some trouble finding organizations that would accept donations from non-Indian citizens, which is why I started this list.
